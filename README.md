The Iris Flower Species Classification project is an illustrative example of how machine learning techniques can be applied to solve real-world problems. The project aims to build a model that can accurately classify iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on a set of botanical features.
Iris flowers are renowned for their diverse species, each exhibiting unique characteristics in terms of petal and sepal dimensions. This project leverages a dataset comprising 150 iris samples, equally distributed among the three species, and four distinct features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
